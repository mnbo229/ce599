It is nice to be able to put these data on a map and see what is going on.  It is even better if we can put it on a map and interact with the data.  It would be even cooler if we could put our interactive map on a website to show it off!\n",

Interactive maps are nice for exploring your data, but static maps work well for an image that you can insert into a paper.  If you want to create static maps, then basemap is a good tool.

We could do the same thing using JavaScript and leaflet directly, but then we would have to learn the syntax for another language.  That might not be too hard, but to keep it simple, we'll stick to the python wrapper for now.  It is good to be aware of, though, because if you want more options than folium allows, you can go directly to leaflet.  \n",

    "In addition, let's go to github and clone the folium repository (https://github.com/python-visualization/folium) to our desktop.  This gives us the source code on our local machine.  What we're really interested in is the examples folder, which gives us a bunch of jupyter notebooks showing how to do different stuff.  You are welcome to explore these as needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "You also need to install geopandas, which will make it easier to work with goegraphic data.  The pip installer doesn't work (the long explanation is here: http://geoffboeing.com/2014/09/using-geopandas-windows/), so we'll install using anaconda.  Type: \n",
